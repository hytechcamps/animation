# Animation for Games
This camp allows students to create some animations of their own. It uses [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com) as a tool for creating pixel art, and a [JavaScript Game](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Platformer) where the art can be used. The game is a modified version of the game from [this tutorial](https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/).

## Icebreaker
Students create pictures using Microsoft Paint, and present their pictures to the class. When presenting the pictures, they can also say their name, grade, and school.

## Lecture: History of Animation / 2D Video Game Animation
There are slides in the [Animation for Games presentation](AnimationForGames.pptx) that introduce the roots of animation and 2D game graphics. The presentation covers:
- Beginnings (Zoetrope, Praxinoscope, First animated film)
- Disney (Many revolutionary techniques)
- Video game origins
- Mario's origins/evolution
- Pixel art
- Walk cycles

## Kahoot
A quiz covering the content from the lecture. There is a link in the slides that points here: https://create.kahoot.it/share/building-blocks-of-animation-quiz/53acd5a6-e3f2-4aca-972d-55f5f4bd8cc4

## Piskel Demo
Demonstrate the use of Piskel by walking through the [Piskel Demo](PiskelDemo.md). After the guided portion, give the students some time to create things on their own.

## Game Animation Follow-Along
Walk through the [Game Animation Follow-Along](GameAnimationFollowAlong.md) as a group. Make sure each student is able to modify the player sprite and place their version in the game. They should not spend too long working on modifications - they can always come back to that and make more changes.

## Animation Challenges
After the follow-along activity, students should have a chance to work on the [challenges](AnimationChallenges.md). There are a few options:

- Working in Piskel to make something brand new
- Modifying existing sprites and placing them into the game
- Updating the game code to change gameplay

Students should be able to hop around and attempt whichever challenges they would like.

## Sharing Art
Toward the end of the session, students should be able to share what they have created. This could be just Piskel sprites, or full game modifications.
