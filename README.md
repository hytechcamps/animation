# Building Blocks of Animation
This camp covers the history of animation in general, then touches on the origins of 2D game graphics and allows students to create some animations of their own. The camp uses [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com) as a tool for creating pixel art, and [Snap](https://snap.berkeley.edu/), a block-based programming language, as a tool for creating a simple 2D platformer. The content flows through the [Building Blocks of Animation presentation](BuildingBlocksOfAnimation.pptx).

## Icebreaker
Students create pictures using Microsoft Paint, and present their pictures to the class. When presenting the pictures, they can also say their name, grade, and school.

## Lecture: History of Animation / 2D Video Game Animation
There are slides in the [Building Blocks of Animation presentation](BuildingBlocksOfAnimation.pptx) that introduce the roots of animation and 2D game graphics. The presentation covers:
- Beginnings (Zoetrope, Praxinoscope, First animated film)
- Disney (Many revolutionary techniques)
- Video game origins
- Mario's origins/evolution
- Pixel art
- Walk cycles

## Kahoot
A quiz covering the content from the lecture. There is a link in the slides that points here: https://create.kahoot.it/share/building-blocks-of-animation-quiz/53acd5a6-e3f2-4aca-972d-55f5f4bd8cc4

## Piskel
Demonstrate the use of [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com) to create pixel art sprites/animations. Show some of the different tools in Piskel, including:

- Pen
- Vertical Mirror pen
- Paint bucket tool
- Stroke tool
- Rectangle tool
- Circle tool
- Move tool
- Color picker
- Multiple frames
- Resize drawing area
- Import existing
- Export as Zip

Additionally, show some examples:
- Mega Man: https://www.piskelapp.com/p/agxzfnBpc2tlbC1hcHByEwsSBlBpc2tlbBiAgICAyJ2kCQw/edit
- Rainbow pattern: https://www.piskelapp.com/p/agxzfnBpc2tlbC1hcHByEwsSBlBpc2tlbBiAgICA_eOjCgw/edit

### Piskel Exercise
Students will follow the instructions in the [Piskel Exercise](PiskelExercise.md) file to create some animations of their own. Students can import `.piskel` files by right-clicking the links in the guide and choosing to save the files. They should import the existing sprites and update them. After that, they can create any pixel art animation of their choosing.

## Snap
Introduce [Snap](https://snap.berkeley.edu/) by following the instructions in the [Snap Demo](SnapDemo.md) file. This should give students a basis for understanding Snap.

### Snap Exercise
Students will follow the instructions in the [Snap Exercise](SnapExercise.md) file to update an existing game with their own art. There are additional challenges in the instructions as well.
